of the Oity, to be answerable unto the King's peace
and unto the citizens of the Oity, for keeping [the
same] without harm.

And if perchanee any person of a strange land, hy
the surcty that he finds, or hythe freedom that has
been granted unto him of the Oity, is about to be-
come a hosteler or herbergeour within the Gity, let
him make provision to reside in the heart of the
City, according to the tenor aforesaid; [and if any
such persons shall be doing otherwise], within forty
days next ensuing after the day on which these
Anticles shall be read and published in the Oity, let
them forego the same and withdraw themselves, that

nevertheless let him be punished with imprisonment,
according as the offence demands·
