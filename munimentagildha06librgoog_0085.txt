Unto Tronage pertain those things which are weighed
hy the King's tron, as also many things that are not
weighed 01011 (that is to say, the custom due upon
wine, wosd, aad other things) : thus, 101 asack 01 wool,
three weys in weight, going out 01 London 10 the
parts beyond sea, hy merchants who owe enatam, the
Sheriff ought 10 have eleven pence [101 Tronage]; and
if there is more wool contained in such sack than three
weys and a hall, or four weys, the Sheriff 011011 take
ior it for the sack no more than eleven pence. And 11 the
merchant has several sacks 01 the said weight going out
01 the Oity, the Sheriff shall take 101 the first sack eleven
pence, arid 10100011 011110 others ten pence. For a
sack of two weys going out of the Oity by merchants
who are liahle to custom, the Sheriff shall receive six
penee. And 11 the merchant has several [such] sacks,
then he shall take 101 the first sack six pencc in manner
aforesaid, and 101 each of the others five penes ; and
if in a sack there is contained more than two weys, he
shall take no more, unless 11 eontain twelve cloves.
But 1111 contains more than twelve cloves, then the
Sheriff shall take 101 11 as much as for a sack 01 three
weys, that is to say, eleven pence. And be it made
known, that ¹worsted in saeks owes the Sheriff nothing,

olores, then he shall take 101 ths same eleven penos, in
