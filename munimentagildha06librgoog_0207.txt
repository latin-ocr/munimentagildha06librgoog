“By reason that complaint has been made by many
“ good folks of the town unto the Mayor, that now
“ io, how that divers times in tho Council wont [to
‘⁸ meet] within the Hali and Ohamhers of the Guildhall,
“ great tumult and peril have been perceived‚ both by
“ reason of the green assemblagee there, and too otton
¹‘ by reason of the insufficient persons deputed unto
‘⁴ the said Oouncils‚ as ostentimes seen in the judg-
‘⁴ ments of the said Councils, [supported] more by cla·
“mour than hy reason ; to the great disturbance of
‘¹ peace and quiet among the people in time past, and
“still more likely in time to come, ifsome remedy
“ be not provided against the same. Upon which, the
“ Mayor, with his Aldermen and the good Commons,
“did ohoosc certain persons, with deliberation to ad-
“ vise thereupon how such tumult and peril might best ,
“ be avoided and remedied; the which persons, meet·
“ ing together upon divers days on the matter aforesaid,
“ have, by way os remedy for such parile, upon con-
“ sideration ordoined tho Anticles arcer-written 3- r. an. a.
‘¹ should it be pleasing unto the Mayor and to the other
“good folks of the city for a time to make trial of
“ the same ; to the intent that if wallare and peace
“ be found in such counnels through the Ordinances
“ aiter-written, the same in the name of God may be
“confirmed And if tha contrary, which may God
‘¹ not will, that tho samo may in due timebo amended,
“for the common good of all the city.

“ First, in order to continue the Common Council of
‘¹ the Oity by persons sufficient, as well in means as in
‘⁴ understanding, hait ordained that each year oster tha
“ Day of Seint Gregory [12 March], when the Aldermen
‘¹ shall have been appointed, the Aldermen appointed
“ for the year ensuing be strictly charged, fiiteen days
