The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the

Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, after a eareful
considerationes the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectnal and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy‚ in making the detailed arrangements,
, without unnecessary expense.”

They 'expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chroniclo and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible eorrect-
ness the textos each writer, derived from a collation ¹of the

best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulare proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentis materiale existed sor that purpose, and
an estimate of his historieal credibility and valuc.
