Ow the aoth of Ianuary 1857, the Master 01 the Rolls
⁸submittcd 10 the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materiale for the History of this Country from the
Invasion 01 the Romans 10 the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should bo selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodieal or chronological arrange- ¹
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materials as were most
scarae and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historioal document
to be editcd should be treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the Master
01 the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age aud
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a brief
account 01 the lise and times 01 the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no other
note or comment was to bc allowed, except what might be

necessary to establish the correctness of the text.
